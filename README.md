<h1>Student Delivery System</h1>

<h3>Product</h3>
<p>
    For my senior project I decided to make a full-stack website. This project contains multiple parts. Front-end development code, front-end production code, server code. This git hub repository contains all the code nessasary to develop and deploy to heroku. When deployed on localhost the "student delivery system" can be accesed through the localhost:8080/delivery/ url.
