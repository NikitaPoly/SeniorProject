            <p><h3>Purpose:</h3> Create a profile website while practicing development skills.><br>
                <h3>Difficulty V1:</h3> When I first created this website during the summer of 2020, the main difficulty was finding the correct technology and language to use. Python servers are very quick and easy to write. Java servers run fast. Only JavaScript can be used for the full project.<br>
                <h3>Difficulty V2:</h3> During my first redesign I wanted to make a smoother looking front-end. Without a framework this was harder, but with the use of flex-bot and css-grid I was able to create responsive layouts. I was unsatisfied with how long it took me to debug JavaScript code, so I added TypeScript for its type safety and version compilation.<br>
                <h3>Difficulty V3:</h3> The most recent update for this website required a complete back-end redesign from Node.js to GO. The new language has the speed of Java and the syntax of Python.<br>
                <h3>Result:</h3> I am happy with how the front-end looks and functions, but next time I wish to learn and apply a framework or library for easier code reusability. <br>
                Technology Used: JS,TS,GO,CSS,HTML,Node.js, Git, HTTP, MongoDB, VScode, Postman, AdobeXD, Chrome dev tools.<br>

            <p>
                <h3>Purpose:</h3>Get experince creating applications for real world test cases.<br>
                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                Final semester at DePauw university I will develop a campus delivery system aimed at students. For this system I will use a GO back-end connected to MongoDB and a framework like boostrap or React. Paypal has a developer friendly API that can be used to connect accounts via Venmo. I will use this api to provide easy payment and cash out options. Application will be online at www.polyakov.tech/deliver after may of 2022.</p>

            <h2>Convolutional Neural Network</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/NikitaPoly/Fashion-MNIST-Models" target="__blanck"><h3>Convolution Neural Network Experiments</h3><img src="Public/Images/Github.svg" alt="GithubLogo" id="logoGithub"></a>
            <p>
                <h3>My Research Experience:</h3>
                During my final year at DePauw university, I took a one-month intensive course in neural networks, specifically deep learning. In this course I got the opportunity to build a dense NN and learn how it is trained to classify handwritten numbers. For our final project I built several convolutional networks with varying activation functions, number, and size of layers, as well as dropout levels. During the process I also learned and applied the TensorFlow keras module. This was a very interesting process combined with data from MNIST and Fashion MNIST data sets. The compilation, fit and analysis of the models was all done in python! Over several experiments I saw that number of layers and density of each layers has a smaller effect on model accuracies compared to data preprocessing and correct life cycle functions. During my time in the class, I also discovered a community of Machine learning experts and enthusiasts. TinyML . Machine Learning requires data and answers, after the machine learning process we are left with a set of rules on how to analyze data for patterns we seek. Traditional software development requires rules and data to find the answers. I find this new “type” of programing exiting as all possibilities of this technology are unexplored. TinyML is particularly exiting due the fact that all the giant models built are broken down into small lower energy consumption models and embedded into field devices. These devices can be left unattended from months to years while collecting data in the field. For my next NN project I want to deeper understand the lifecycle functions of the model.</p>
